    <h1>Michael Ljungh
        <p class="info">Michael Ljungh is a graduate of Cleveland Institute of Music with a double degree in Cello Performance and Suzuki Pedagogy. Having studied with Russian teacher Alex Zhiroff, LA Opera principal cellist John Walz, NYU professor Marion Feldman, and Cleveland Orchestra assistant principal cellist Richard Weiss, Michael has learned cello using a diverse array of techniques. His personal teaching employs techniques from all his training. Since 2011, when he first taught serving as an assistant teacher to John Walz at the Idyllwild Arts summer program, Michael has wanted to teach. In high school, Irvine provided him many opportunities, including performing Kol Nidre with the Pacific Symphony Youth Orchestra at the luxurious Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall as a reward for winning their concerto competition. Michael also had the fortune of performing in Sydney Opera Hall, Carnegie Hall, cathedrals throughout France, and Walt Disney Concert Hall. These experiences are thanks to his being apart of Irvine youth orchestras and other local programs. He has returned to teach in his classical music appreciating hometown so that his students can have as many diverse chances to explore cello playing as possible..</p>
